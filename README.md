# Funny Prank Sounds App ‚úîÔ∏è

## Android MVVM Architecture Sample (ViewModel + LiveData + Repository + Hilt + DataBinding + ViewBinding + Coroutines + Kotlin )

### App features
1. List of sounds and their categories.
2. Play sounds with animation and the user can play sounds in a loop and can delay the sound to play.
3. User can mark sounds as favorite.
4. User can change the language of app from settings.
5. User can share and rate the application.



#### A simple Entertaiment App üì± built to demonstrate the use of modern android architecture component with MVVM Architecture üèó

### Build With üèóÔ∏è
- [Kotlin] - Programming language for Android
- [Hilt-Dagger] - Standard library to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [Room] - SQLite object mapping library.
- [Coroutines] - To make Asynchronus network calls
- [LiveData] - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
- [ViewModel] - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
- [ViewBinding] - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Jetpack Navigation] - Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app.
- [Glide] - An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth loading.
- [Firebase-Crashlytics] - Third-party library to track crashes in app during and after publishing.
